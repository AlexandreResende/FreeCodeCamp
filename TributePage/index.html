		                Alan Mathinson Turing was an English  computer scientist, mathematician, logician,  cryptanalist and theoretical biologist who
		                highly influenced the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and
		                computation with the Turing machine.
		              </p>
		              <p>
						During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher
						School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre. For a time 
						he led Hut 8, the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised
						a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including 
						improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that
						could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking
						intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many 
						crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic; it has been estimated 
						that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 
						fourteen million lives.
		              </p>
		              <p>
						After the war, he worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the 
						ACE, among the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948 Turing joined 
						Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester, 
						where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical
						biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis, and predicted 
						oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousovâ€“Zhabotinsky reaction, first 
						observed in the 1960s.
		              </p>
		              <p>
						Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, when by the Labouchere Amendment,
						"gross indecency" was still criminal in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment,
						with DES, as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd 
						birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as suicide, but it 
						has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning.
						In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an
						official public apology on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he
						was treated." Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous pardon in 2013.
